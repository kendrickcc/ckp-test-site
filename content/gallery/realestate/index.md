## My real estate work

I started shooting real estate for a local media company in May, 2021 through June, 2022. Learned a lot and started to try my hand at virtual tours. The virtual tours were captured using an inexpensive fisheye lens on a panoramic head, using PTGui to process them. Then put together using Marzipano Tool. 

An example of a [virtual tour](https://20220418toursample.z19.web.core.windows.net). This link will send you to another web site where I keep these tours. You may want to right-click and choose open in a new tab or window.
