### Background
I've been attempting macro photography for some time, but didn't really know why I wasn't happy with my results. Realized I wasn't working on my focus stacking techique. 

For example, I really like this photo. But I could have done so much better had I taken the time to get tack-sharp focus on all of the flower, bringing out all the details of the droplets in the background as well as the foreground. I didn't focus stack the subject. I didn't know to do that.

### Since then...

...I learned about focus stacking. I had on hand a geared head, the [Benro GD3WH](https://benrousa.com/benro-gd3wh-3-way-geared-head/) from my real estate work. And I have a [Sony 90mm macro lens](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/lenses/full-frame-e-mount/p/sel90m28g). While this is not needed, I did get a [NiSi NM-180 focusing rail](https://nisiopticsusa.com/product/nisi-macro-focusing-rail-nm-180-with-360-degree-rotating-clamp/). You can do focus stacking by simply changing the focus length in the lens. However that can be challenging as you are then touching the lens and having to either look at the back LCD or view finder to check the focus peaking. The focusing rail is simpler as you only need to crank the lever thereby moving the body and camera in and out.

#### Pine cones setup

I have a couple of black acryllic squares and I placed the pine cones on them, facing toward ambient light. After trial and error I landed on setting the camera to f/8, ISO 125. Because I was only using ambient light, my shutter speed ended up being 6 seconds. Caveat: I did have a small LED light adding light to the back of the cones. The aperture of f/8 was chosen because of the number of frames needed to capture foreground to background. I could open the aperture up more, faster shutter speed, but that would result in many more images. With this setting I ended up with 10 images to stack. {{<figure src="bridge.jpeg" title="10 images at f/8, 6 seconds, ISO 125, 90mm">}}

#### Photoshop

There are numerous articles showing how to do focus stacking in Photoshop. With shots of the moon, for example, where you are not changing focus between shots, this probably works great. And if I wanted to spend a lot of time in Photoshop, it probably would work great. As shown, each layer is stacked in Photoshop, aligned, then using auto-blend layers. Photoshop builds a mask for each layer it detects is sharp. You can then edit each mask for parts of the image as needed. But that means you need to toggle layers, edit the mask, toggle back on, rinse, repeat. It is also much slower using Photoshop because it is processing each image, converting to a layer, then building masks for each layer. Prepare to hear the CPU fan kick in, full speed. {{<figure src="photoshop.jpeg" title="Photoshop layers after auto-blend">}}

#### Enter Helicon Focus

There are also a lot of articles referring to [Helicon Focus](https://www.heliconsoft.com/heliconsoft-products/helicon-focus/). I download the trial copy and it was already producing very nice results. I ended up purchasing the Pro version because I prefer working with RAW/DNG files versus JPG. The Helicon Remote feature appeals to me, but since I am a Sony body shooter, it is of no use (sigh). This process is much, much faster. And if you use the batch feature, you can generate multiple images using all processing methods. Load images, select methods, render, done.{{<figure src="helicon.jpeg" title="Helicon Focus">}}

#### Well not quite done...

If you look close at the above images you can see a lot of dust and other distracting things in the image. I've not tried the retouching features in Helicon. Mostly because I know how to do this well enough in Photoshop. So back to Photoshop! Here I removed dust, painted in areas to clear up the background, adjust things like exposure, contrast, etc., And because I purchased Helicon Focus Pro, I can get a DNG file back out of it which means more data to work with in Photoshop. {{<figure src="featureImage.jpeg" title="Photoshop post edits">}}
