The annual Easter Concours d’Elegance held in Forest Park in 2022, hosted by the [Horseless Carriage Club of Missouri](http://hccmo.com), one of the oldest car clubs in the world. I was trying to use a fisheye lens to get some interesting images of the cars. As I am a huge St Louis Cardinals baseball fan, I chose to wear a red pull over that day. Many of the grills I photographed reflected that. Lesson learned. But here are some of the better images from that day.
