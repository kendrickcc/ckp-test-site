### About Me

**G**rew up on a farm in Northeast Missouri, went to college in Southwest Missouri and got an agronomy degree, went to work for a government agency in, you guessed it, agriculture and then retired after 32 years at my first opportunity.

So then what... well I didn't think I was going to stay in agriculture.

My father had a Pentax camera and some really nice lenses with it. I really had no appreciation for them but knew he took a lot of photographs and had some neat equipment. In grade school a class mate and I made a pinhole camera and actually had some success. I think that was the trigger that got me into photography. Once in high school, I worked as a photographer for the school year book and other publications. I converted my closet into a darkroom and developed and produced black and white prints. But once in college it fell to the side, then family, then work, blah, blah, blah....

Once I made my decision to retire, I knew I needed to have an outlet and decided to get back into photography. I also at this time developed an interest in drones, and I knew I wanted to incorporate that. Upon retirement, I purchased some equipment and worked to find jobs.

This was at the end of 2019 and I was getting out and starting to shoot live music events to build a portfolio. Then in early 2020, as with the world, we were all shut down.

I spent the downtime working on my remote pilot certificate and was lucky enough to get into a testing center before they all closed, and obtained my FAA remote pilot certificate. I figured since I no longer had music venues to go to, I may be able to find gigs using a drone. I did and it happened to be in... can you guess... agriculture, scouting corn, soybeans and cotton. 

I'm focusing now more in photogrammetry, mapping missions using drones to provide 3D models, ortho-mosaics. But when I'm not flying I still try to get out and snap a few images here and there.
