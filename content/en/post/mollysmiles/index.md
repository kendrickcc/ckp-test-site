[Molly's Miles](https://mollysmilesrun.com) is a mid-Missouri event benefiting the Concerns of Police Survivors (C.O.P.S.) held late April.

I first volunterred to photograph the 2020 race event but that was cancelled due to Covid-19. Afterwards the lead photographer moved away and I volunterred to became team lead. I've been heading up the photography team for the past two years. A rewarding experience and a very worthy cause.
